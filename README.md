## 🧠 Value Proposition

I build backend and automation systems by **starting from the problem, not the stack**.

My work focuses on designing controlled, reliable systems that operate under real-world constraints — where correctness, clear scope, and predictable behavior matter more than surface-level features.

---

## 🚀 About Me

- Backend-focused engineer interested in **systems behavior, automation, and correctness**
- Design projects around **explicit problem spaces and constraints**
- Comfortable owning a system **end-to-end** when required
- Prefer **fewer projects with deeper engineering** over rapid feature accumulation
- Actively improving engineering judgment through real failure modes and trade-offs

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Used in Real Projects)

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
**Backend & Automation:** Python, JavaScript  
**Databases:** MongoDB  
**Systems & DevOps:** Linux, Bash, Docker  

> Tools are chosen based on the problem — not the other way around.

---

## 💻 Selected Projects

Each project represents a **distinct engineering problem space**.  
No overlap. Each earns its place.

### 🔐 CVEStrike — Automated Threat Intelligence

**Problem**  
Security teams face an overwhelming stream of vulnerability disclosures with little prioritization.

**What I Built**  
An automated system that ingests CVE and security advisory data, structures it, and analyzes it to surface relevant security insights efficiently, reducing manual monitoring overhead.

### 🕷️ Spiderweb Crawler — Website Structure Discovery

**Problem**  
Naive crawling of websites leads to duplication, infinite loops, and unreliable structural data.

**What I Built**  
A Python-based crawler that recursively maps internal website structure while preventing duplication, avoiding cycles, and enforcing controlled traversal.

### 🛰️ Satellite — Computational Visualization System

**Problem**  
Mathematical and orbital data is difficult to interpret without accurate transformations and visualization.

**What I Built**  
A system that converts mathematical satellite models into an interactive visual representation, maintaining accuracy across coordinate transformations and time-based updates.

### ✨ SparkleVision — Real-Time Visual Interaction

**Problem**  
Real-time visual systems require low-latency pipelines and consistent frame handling.

**What I Built**  
A computer-vision pipeline that processes live visual input and produces immediate visual feedback, focusing on frame consistency and low-latency rendering.

## 🚧 Currently Building

- Backend-heavy systems focused on **automation, data correctness, and real-world constraints**
- Projects designed to reflect **production-style environments**, not tutorials

---

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

- **Backend Engineer / Software Engineer Intern / Junior roles**
- Work involving **real system development, automation, or backend logic**
- Teams that value **engineering depth, clean design, and ownership**
